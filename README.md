# NumberFrequency

A number frequency calculator that uses a REST server. Any number array may be POSTed, and the frequency of each number in that array will be returned. 
The program will sort the numbers from lowest to highest, and it will also add the missing numbers. 
If the user POSTs an array of [0,0,3], 1 and 2 will be added in the correct order (of course with the frequency of 0).
